Local Storage provides persistent storage that persists across browser sessions, while Session Storage offers temporary storage that is cleared when the page session ends. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired behavior of the stored data


Local Storage and Session Storage are both web storage mechanisms provided by browsers to store key-value pairs locally on the client-side. However, they have some differences:

Scope:

Local Storage: Data stored in Local Storage persists even after the browser is closed and is available across browser sessions. It is scoped to the origin (i.e., protocol, domain, and port) from which it was set.
Session Storage: Data stored in Session Storage is available only for the duration of the page session. Once the page session ends (e.g., when the tab or window is closed), the data is cleared and no longer accessible. It is also scoped to the origin.
Lifetime:

Local Storage: Data in Local Storage persists indefinitely until explicitly cleared by the user or by script.
Session Storage: Data in Session Storage persists only for the duration of the page session. It is cleared when the page session ends, either by closing the tab/window or by navigating away from the page.
